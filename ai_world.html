					<p>Do you question how Facebook suggests tagging a person by just recognizing the face in the image?... Crazy, right? Well, technology has been getting crazier day by day, and just when we thought we reached the limit, there was the birth of AI. Let’s look back to the history of AI.

						In 1950, the Turing test, originally called an imitation game, by computer scientist Alan Turing was proposed which tests if machines can trick humans into thinking it as human and possess human intelligence. Here, the question arises-Has any machine passed the Turing test, yet? According to the article published originally in October,2021 by <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/turing-test-imitation-game/#:~:text=The%20so%2Dcalled%20Turing%20test,ever%20passed%20the%20Turing%20test">Big think </a>human intelligence hasn’t been achieved yet.

						<br>

						But all these crazy technological branches like computer vision, natural language processing, face detection, and recognition…Aren’t these just awesome? Indeed they are, but we still can improve more with expanded research in these fields. After the 1950’s Turing test brought a big turn in the CS world, John McCarthy came up with the word “Artificial intelligence” in 1955 and described it as ‘the science and engineering of making machines intelligent.’ Widely known as the Father of AI, McCarthy, then, inspired American inventor George Devol to build the first-ever industrial robot, Unimate, in 1961. After this ELIZA: a chatbot that had a conversation with a human for the first time and SHAKEY: the first known electronic person from Stanford shook the CS world. My favorite AI history of all time is when Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer from IBM Defeated world chess champion, Gary Kasparov in 1997. By this time many companies started realizing the prospects of AI and started innovating new technologies. Sony launched the first consumer pet robot-AIBO-in 1999. But, the best friends of this generation, Alexa and Siri were actually quite late in the race. Siri was integrated by the Apple into iPhone 4s only in 2011, and Alexa was launched by Amazon to help with shopping tasks in 2014. Though many people have claimed Alexa is better than Siri, Siri here was born first.

						<br>
						To date, almost all companies are researching further to know how AI can benefit their business. 
						<br>
						Face detection, one of the significant computer technologies which detect faces in the image is used widely these days. Highlight this when I state, face detection is different than face recognition. Face detection refers to detecting the location of the face in the given image while face recognition identifies who the person is. A biometric system uses both: First, it detects where the face is and recognizes the person.

                        In next article, I will summarize what I learned while learning about Face detection and write the step-by-step procedures with a tutorial video...stay tuned
